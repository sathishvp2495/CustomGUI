This repo is mainly a playground for experimenting with using React to render to [canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) in a declarative fashion.

If you are interested in how I made it work, I have [a blog post](http://goshakkk.name/react-custom-renderers/) explaining just that.
